Topics covered:

- Limitations of Kogge-stone:
- Efficiency is low - Much more ops than sequential scan.
- Intermediate results can be shared more
- Lot of control divergence - Due to the nature of mapping of threads
- Consumes lot of execution resources

Brent-kung algo
- Reduction and a reverse tree to complement it.
- More steps but lesser ops. 
- More enrgy efficient.
- Better mapping of threads meaning very less control divergence.
