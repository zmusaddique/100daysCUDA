## Learnings

Ch5 of PMPP:
Learned about types of memory in CUDA GPUs

- On chip memory architecture
- Memory and Compute bound programs
- Memory Types:
    - Global
    - Local
    - Shared
    - Constant
    - Registers

- Concept of Tiling - to reduce global memory access latency

Tile indexing for 2nd Matrix ie. selecting element from a colum can be tricky
